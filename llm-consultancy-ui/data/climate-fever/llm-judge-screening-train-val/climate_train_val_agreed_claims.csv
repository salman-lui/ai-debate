"the minute increase of anthropogenic co2 in the atmosphere (0.008%) was not the cause of the warming—it was a continuation of natural cycles that occurred over the past 500 years.""",False,refutes,"the introduction includes this statement: there is strong evidence that the warming of the earth over the last half-century has been caused largely by human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use, including agriculture and deforestation.",refutes,scientific consensus on climate change
the long term warming trend indicates the total energy in the earth's climate system is increasing due to an energy imbalance.,True,disputed,"earth is very close to being in radiative equilibrium, the situation where the incoming solar energy is balanced by an equal flow of heat to space; under that condition, global temperatures will be relatively stable.",refutes,earth's energy budget
"for example, we have a lower understanding of the effect of aerosols while we have a high understanding of the warming effect of carbon dioxide.",True,disputed,"in 2000, hansen advanced an alternative view of global warming over the last 100 years, arguing that during that time frame the negative forcing via aerosols and the positive forcing via carbon dioxide (co 2) largely balanced each other out, and that the 0.74±0.18 °c net rise in average global temperatures could mostly be explained by greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide, such as methane and chlorofluorocarbons.",refutes,james hansen
volcanoes emit around 0.3 billion tonnes of co2 per year.,True,disputed,"in total 24,000 tonnes of co2 was emitted.",not_enough_info,hekla
"however, satellite and surface measurements observe an enhanced greenhouse effect at the wavelengths that co2 absorb energy.",True,supports,"less energy reaches the upper atmosphere, which is therefore cooler because of this absorption.",not_enough_info,carbon dioxide
individual carbon dioxide molecules have a short life time of around 5 years in the atmosphere.,False,refutes,"carbon dioxide in earth's atmosphere is a trace gas, currently (mid 2018) having a global average concentration of 409 parts per million by volume (or 622 parts per million by mass).",not_enough_info,carbon dioxide
"if the co2 effect was saturated, adding more co2 should add no additional greenhouse effect.",True,supports,other scientists were initially sceptical and believed the greenhouse effect to be saturated so that adding more co 2 would make no difference.,supports,global warming
"the ""decline"" refers to a decline in northern tree-rings, not global temperature, and is openly discussed in papers and the ipcc reports.",True,supports,"the implications of the decline are discussed in chapter 2 of the ipcc third assessment report, and in chapter 6 of the 2007 ipcc fourth assessment report (ar4) which describes discussion of various possible reasons for the divergence which does not affect all the trees, and says that there is no consensus about the cause.",not_enough_info,climatic research unit documents
"far from contradicting global warming, record snowfall is predicted by climate models and consistent with our expectation of more extreme precipitation events.",True,supports,"simultaneously, the capacity of the atmosphere to carry precipitation increases with temperature so that precipitation, in the form of snowfall, increases in global and regional models.",supports,sea level rise
measurements of carbon isotopes and falling oxygen in the atmosphere show that rising carbon dioxide is due to the burning of fossil fuels and cannot be coming from the ocean.,True,supports,co2 emissions are continuing to rise due to the burning of fossil fuels and land-use change.,supports,global warming
"while there are many drivers of climate, co2 is the most dominant radiative forcing and is increasing faster than any other forcing.",True,supports,"human activity since the industrial revolution has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to increased radiative forcing from co2, methane, tropospheric ozone, cfcs, and nitrous oxide.",supports,global warming
"when you account for the effects which are not reflected in the market price of fossil fuels, like air pollution and health impacts, the true cost of coal and other fossil fuels is higher than the cost of most renewable energy technologies.",True,supports,the health impact of transport emissions is also of concern.,not_enough_info,human impact on the environment
australia accounts for 1.5 per cent of global carbon emissions.,False,refutes,"""australia's carbon dioxide emissions twice world rate"".",not_enough_info,australia
"global brightening is caused by changes in cloud cover, reflective aerosols and absorbing aerosols.",True,disputed,aerosols and other particulates absorb solar energy and reflect sunlight back into space.,supports,global dimming
maximum warming occurs over the surface during winter while less surface warming is found in summer when heat is being used to melt sea ice.,True,supports,"in summer, the sea ice keeps the surface from warming above freezing.",not_enough_info,climate of the arctic
"as a result, the planet as a whole is becoming less reflective and absorbing more sunlight, which is accelerating global warming.",True,supports,"not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea level rise.",supports,global warming
"""a paper...in science magazine concludes that the climate sensitivity—how much the earth’s average temperature will rise as a result of a doubling of the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide—likely (that is, with a 66% probability) lies in the range 1.7°c to 2.6°c, with a median value of 2.3°c.",True,disputed,"the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ecs) is the temperature increase that would result from sustained doubling of the concentration of carbon dioxide in earth's atmosphere, after the earth's energy budget and the climate system reach radiative equilibrium.",not_enough_info,climate sensitivity
"given that a doubling of carbon dioxide would change the surface heat flux by only two watts per square meter, it is evident that a small change in cloud cover can strongly affect the response to carbon dioxide.""",True,supports,"a typical value of λ, 0.8 k/(w/m2), gives an increase in global temperature of about 1.6 k above the 1750 reference temperature due to the increase in co 2 over that time (278 to 405 ppm, for a forcing of 2.0 w/m2), and predicts a further warming of 1.4 k above present temperatures if the co 2 mixing ratio in the atmosphere were to become double its pre-industrial value; both of these calculations assume no other forcings.",not_enough_info,radiative forcing
