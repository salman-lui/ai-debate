"however, more direct comparisons between solar activity and global temperature finds that  as the sun grew hotter or cooler, earth's climate followed it with a 10 year lag - presumably due to the dampening effect of the ocean.",False,refutes,another line of evidence for the warming not being due to the sun is how temperature changes differ at different levels in the earth's atmosphere.,not_enough_info,global warming
