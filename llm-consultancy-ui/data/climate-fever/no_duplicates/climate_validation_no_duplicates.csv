"however, more direct comparisons between solar activity and global temperature finds that  as the sun grew hotter or cooler, earth's climate followed it with a 10 year lag - presumably due to the dampening effect of the ocean.",False,refutes,another line of evidence for the warming not being due to the sun is how temperature changes differ at different levels in the earth's atmosphere.,not_enough_info,global warming

"""a paper...in science magazine concludes that the climate sensitivity—how much the earth’s average temperature will rise as a result of a doubling of the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide—likely (that is, with a 66% probability) lies in the range 1.7°c to 2.6°c, with a median value of 2.3°c.",True,disputed,"the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ecs) is the temperature increase that would result from sustained doubling of the concentration of carbon dioxide in earth's atmosphere, after the earth's energy budget and the climate system reach radiative equilibrium.",not_enough_info,climate sensitivity
