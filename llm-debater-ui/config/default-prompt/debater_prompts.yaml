          - Appropriate emotional appeals when relevant
          - Questioning of opposing assumptions

        * Skill in addressing counterarguments and exploiting weaknesses in opponent's arguments
        * Effectiveness in responding to judge's questions convincingly
        * Strategic framing and control of debate narrative
