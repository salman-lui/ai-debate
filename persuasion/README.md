# Persuasion Techniques
We use the persuasion strategy taxonomy proposed in Costello et al. 2024 to analyze how consultants and
debaters convince human judges. We use LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-Flash) as evaluators to rate the prevalence of each strategy on an ordinal scale that ranges from ‘none’ to ‘high’. ```persuasion_techniques.ipynb``` has prompts and code to reformat the transcripts to reproduce the results (Table 3).
